# NFTCurator
NFTCurator is an innovative JavaScript library designed to personalize the experience of exploring Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Built on top of the NFTVisor and leveraging the brain.js neural network library, it aims to curate NFT collections according to user preferences through machine learning.

Features
Personalized NFT Recommendations: Utilizes user preferences to curate NFTs from specified collections, ensuring a tailored browsing experience.
Machine Learning Integration: Employs a neural network model to analyze and predict user interest in various NFTs based on their metadata and user-provided preferences.
Scalable and Adaptable: Designed to work with any Ethereum-based NFT collection, with the ability to train the model with specific user interaction data for enhanced accuracy over time.
Installation
To use NFTCurator in your project, you first need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

npm install nftvisor brain.js
Then, you can include NFTCurator in your project:

const NFTCurator = require('./path/to/NFTCurator');
Usage
Initialization
Before using NFTCurator, initialize it with the URL of your Ethereum provider:

const curator = new NFTCurator('https://your-ethereum-provider.url');
Training the Model
To make accurate recommendations, you must first train the neural network model with training data derived from user interactions. This step is crucial for the model to learn and make predictions.

const trainingData = [
    // Your training data here
];
curator.trainNetwork(trainingData);
Curating NFTs
Once the model is trained, you can curate NFTs based on user preferences:

const userPreferences = {
    // User preferences
};

curator.curateNFTs('collectionSlug', userPreferences).then(curatedNFTs => {
    console.log(curatedNFTs);
});
Example
Here's a simple example of how to use NFTCurator to fetch and curate NFTs from a specific collection:

(async () => {
    const curator = new NFTCurator('https://your-ethereum-provider.url');

    // Example training data and user preferences
    const trainingData = [
        // Populate with real user interaction data
    ];
    const userPreferences = {
        // Define user preferences for NFT curation
    };

    curator.trainNetwork(trainingData);
    const curatedNFTs = await curator.curateNFTs('cool-cats-nft', userPreferences);

    console.log('Curated NFTs:', curatedNFTs);
})();
